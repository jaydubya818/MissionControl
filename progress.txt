    - Alert cards with one-click actions (Unblock, Acknowledge, Resolve, Ignore)
    - Integrated into tasks view

#### Follow-Up Work (6 items shipped)
11. **Context Router Package** — Created packages/context-router/
    - Tier 1 rule-based classifier (intent, complexity, task type)
    - ContextRouter with custom rules, capacity/budget checks
    - Routes to COORDINATOR, SINGLE_TASK, CLARIFY, REJECT, or DEFER
    - 38 unit tests passing
12. **Integration Tests** — Created convex/__tests__/integration.test.ts
    - Context Router → Coordinator decomposition flow
    - Coordinator → Delegation pipeline
    - Decomposition → Dependency graph validation
    - CoordinatorLoop.tick() stuck detection and escalation
    - 12 integration tests, 42 total tests passing at root
13. **Deprecated agent-runner** — Marked packages/agent-runner as deprecated
    - Updated root package.json scripts to use orchestration-server
    - Added deprecation warning to agent-runner
    - Retained for legacy compatibility
14. **Updated progress.txt** — This file
15. **Budget Burn-Down UI** — Created BudgetBurnDown.tsx
    - Per-agent and per-project budget visualization
    - Spend tracking with progress bars and alerts
16. **Convex Deployment Validation** — Verified schema and function consistency

#### Previous Session Work (carried forward)
- Fixed 5 bugs (AgentDashboard Tailwind, Convex SDK, state casing, loop detection, agentLearning)
- Added FAILED terminal state (9 states total)
- Created 11 agent persona YAML files in agents/
- Created packages/agent-runtime (persona loader, lifecycle, heartbeat, 19 tests)
- Created packages/coordinator (decomposer, delegator, dep graph, loop, 26 tests)
- Created packages/memory (session, project, global tiers, 18 tests)
- Implemented heartbeat recovery in convex/agents.ts
- Unit tests for state-machine, policy-engine (all passing)

### What is working:
- Convex backend: 21 tables (added taskDependencies), 60+ queries, 50+ mutations, cron jobs
- React dashboard: Kanban, agent management, approvals, analytics, monitoring, live feed
- **NEW** Mission DAG view: dependency graph visualization
- **NEW** Explainability panel: "Why?" tab in task drawer
- **NEW** Loop detection UI: alerts with one-click actions
- **NEW** Budget burn-down: per-agent/project spend visualization
- State machine: 9 states (UPPERCASE) with validated transitions and FAILED state
- Policy engine: GREEN/YELLOW/RED risk classification + centralized classifier in Convex
- Budget enforcement: per-agent daily, per-task, per-run
- Loop detection: comment storms, review ping-pong, repeated failures, back-and-forth (cron)
- Emergency controls: pause squad, quarantine, drain, resume
- Telegram bot: approvals, squad commands, daily CEO briefs
- **NEW** Orchestration server: Hono-based coordinator + agent runtime host
- Agent runtime: persona loading, lifecycle management, heartbeat monitor, memory integration
- Heartbeat recovery: stale detection, auto-quarantine, task blocking, alerts (cron)
- Coordinator: task decomposition, delegation, dependency graph, orchestration loop
- **NEW** Context router: intent classification + routing (Tier 1 rule-based)
- **NEW** Model router: Claude provider, cost estimation, fallback chains
- Memory system: session, project, global tiers with unified manager
- Agent learning: performance tracking, pattern discovery, project insights
- **NEW** Performance-based task routing: success rate + refute count in scoring
- **NEW** Executor router cron: auto-routes every 5 minutes
- OpenClaw SDK: external agent integration
- Multi-project workspace support
- Docker Compose deployment
- Unit tests: state-machine, policy-engine, agent-runtime, coordinator, memory, context-router (all passing)
- **NEW** Integration tests: context-router -> coordinator -> agent-runtime pipeline

### What is broken / known issues:
- packages/agent-runner is deprecated (use orchestration-server instead)
- No Tier 2 (LLM-based) classifier in context-router yet (Phase 3)
- Model router only has Claude provider (add OpenAI, Gemini in Phase 3)
- Orchestration server not yet deployed to production
- No end-to-end tests with live Convex instance

### What is next (Phase 3):
1. Add Tier 2 LLM-based classifier to context-router (for ambiguous inputs)
2. Add OpenAI/GPT provider to model-router
3. Add Gemini provider to model-router
4. Multi-model consensus for RED-risk tasks (Phase 5 target, but can prototype)
5. Deploy orchestration server (Docker + health checks)
6. End-to-end tests with Convex dev instance
7. Agent persona hot-reload (watch YAML files, update runtime)
8. Remove packages/agent-runner entirely (after migration validation)

### Architecture decisions made:
- Backend is Convex-native (no Express API server)
- Real-time via Convex reactive subscriptions (no WebSocket/SSE)
- Background jobs via Convex crons (no standalone worker processes)
- Orchestration server: Hono (docs/decisions/001-orchestration-architecture.md)
- State machine uses UPPERCASE status strings everywhere
- FAILED is a terminal state (recoverable to INBOX by human only)
- Model router ships Claude-only first; add other providers in Phase 3
- Context router uses 2-tier architecture: rules first, LLM fallback
- Consensus mode (multi-model voting) deferred to Phase 5
- agent-runner deprecated in favor of agent-runtime + orchestration-server

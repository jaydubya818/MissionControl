# Code Simplifier

When asked to **simplify**, **clean up**, **refactor**, or **tidy** code:

## Rules

1. **Preserve behavior** – No functional changes. Same inputs → same outputs.
2. **Focus scope** – Prefer recently modified or in-context files. Don't spread changes unnecessarily.
3. **Run first** – If tests or build exist, run them before and after. Report any breakage.
4. **One concern per change** – Extract helpers, remove duplication, improve names. Avoid mixed cleanups.
5. **Avoid over-engineering** – Simple and readable beats clever. Don't add abstractions unless they reduce complexity.

## What to Do

- Remove dead code and unused imports
- Simplify conditionals (early returns, guard clauses)
- Extract repeated logic into small helpers
- Improve variable/function names for clarity
- Reduce nesting (max 2–3 levels)
- Drop redundant comments; keep docs that explain *why*

## What NOT to Do

- Change APIs, types, or function signatures without explicit request
- Introduce new dependencies
- Rewrite working code from scratch
- Add premature optimizations

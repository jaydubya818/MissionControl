## Thread-per-Task (Future)

When implemented, each task will have its own Telegram thread:

- Task creation → Create Telegram thread
- Store `threadRef` (chat:message_id) on task
- Agent messages → Post to task thread
- Human replies in thread → Post to Mission Control

---

## Architecture

### Command Flow

```
User → Telegram → Bot → Convex Mutation/Query → Response → Telegram
```

### Notification Flow

```
Convex Mutation → Store Notification → Bot Polls → Format → Send to Telegram
```

### User State

User's active project is stored in-memory (for MVP) or in a `userSessions` table:

```typescript
userSessions: {
  telegramUserId: number;
  activeProjectId: Id<"projects">;
  lastCommandAt: number;
}
```

---

## Security

- **Bot Token:** Keep secret, never commit to git
- **Chat ID:** Only authorized chat/group can receive notifications
- **User Auth:** Commands should verify user is authorized (future)
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting for commands (future)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding

1. Check bot is running: `pnpm dev` in `packages/telegram-bot`
2. Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set
3. Check logs for errors
4. Test with `/start` command

### Commands Not Working

1. Ensure project is selected: `/switch <slug>`
2. Check Convex URL is correct
3. Verify Convex is running: `pnpm dev` in root
4. Check bot logs for errors

### Notifications Not Sending

1. Verify `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` is set
2. Check bot has permission to send to chat/group
3. Review notification logs in Convex activities
